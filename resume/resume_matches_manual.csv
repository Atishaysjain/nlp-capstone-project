Experience
Company Name July 2011 to November 2012 Accountant 
City , State
Enterprise Resource Planning Office (ERO)
In this position as an Accountant assigned to the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) ERO I was
responsible for identifying and resolving issues affecting the DEAMS General Ledger.
I worked with teammates from the Procure to Pay, Orders to Cash, and Budget to Report areas to resolve daily challenges encountered
with the deployment of DEAMS to additional customers and when system change requests were promoted to production.
I supported the testing of scripts, patches, and system change requests ensuring any anomalies were identified to the DEAMS Functional
Management Office for action by the DEAMS Program Management Office and/or the System Integrator.
In addition, I served on a tiger team designed to identify and resolve General Ledger posting differences and supported the development of
$360B in accounting adjustments allowing for the first successful fiscal year-end close in 2012.
These actions also allowed for the reconciliation and closure of fiscal year 2010 and 2011 accounting adjustments ensuring that all DEAMS
fiscal year-end requirements were completed.
These actions were recognized as critical to the successful review report issued by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center
(AFOTEC) resulting in the Air Force receiving the authority to continue with the deployment of DEAMS.
Company Name April 2010 to June 2011 Resource Advisor 
City , State
In this position as Resource Advisor for the 1st Air Communications Operation Squadron (1ACOS) I was responsible for providing
financial advice and decision support to the Commander.
I was responsible for coordinating a $4.6M budget between four funding sources.
I coordinated with USAFE Directorate of Intelligence (USAFE/A2), USAFE Directorate of Air and Space Operations (USAFE/A3),
USAFE Directorate of Communications (USAFE/A6) and the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing to ensure 1ACOS meets its mission
requirements.
I consistently managed three separate timelines for providing budget/unfunded requirements, providing documentation and various reports in
the required format for each organization.
I discussed the outcome of the Group and Directorate budget meetings providing feedback the same day to the Flight Chiefs and CC any
issue which affects 1ACOS directly.
I monitored the Defense Travel System (DTS) daily and identify orders and authorizations needing approval and provided notification to the
appropriate Reviewing Officials and Approvers.
Utilizing DTS and the General Accounting and Finance System I reviewed status reports to identify anomalies in obligations and have
identified those orders which require correction prior to payment.
I provided Government Purchase Card (GPC) status reports the same day they are requested and in addition, communicated with the
appropriate cardholders when changes were required to support their program.
I identified cardholder training requirements and monitored these requirements to ensure all required training was completed in support of
this mission critical program.
I developed guidance for the GPC cardholders on procedures for requesting training for the squadron and in addition I provided answers to
cardholder questions on unique or non-standard issues/concerns.
 Assumed the role of the Billing Official during my final rating period and completed a self inspection of the program for the Management
Control Program, zero findings.
During yearly audit by 700th CONS received zero findings.
Company Name July 2008 to April 2010 Staff Accountant 
City , State
In my position as the Staff Accountant for HQ USAFE I was responsible for providing accounting and financial oversight and advice to
customers throughout the Command in support of the USAFE Comptroller.
I was responsible for performing ongoing analysis of financial programs to identify negative trends and weaknesses, ensured specific
weaknesses were corrected, and determined whether systemic or repeat issues were identified and adequately addressed.
I was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis/reporting requirements and data produced to resolve these issues.
In collaboration with DFAS Europe, developed an automated tool that identifies duplicate obligations by comparing records in the
accounting system to the contracting system and provided notification to the funds manager for review and resolution.
This tool eliminated hours of manual research and results allowed HQ USAFE to deobligate over $5M in duplicate obligations.
I was responsible for establishing various performance metrics which ensured effective and efficient use of USAFE financial resources.
I supported the USAFE/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool
that provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to
the GPC.
This tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE/FMA.
This tool provided the capability for USAFE/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop/deploy joint guidance that supports
the established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of
funds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.
I identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.
My research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and
DFAS personnel.
This not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.
I partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition.
I identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in
FMSuite.
By utilizing Defense Connect Online I provided training remotely, virtually eliminating the need to expend funds on Temporary Duty (TDY)
travel.
The results of this training produced results that went well above expectations and were noted by the ODA Program Management Office.
Company Name January 2007 to July 2009 Chief, Reports Branch. Accounts Maintenance and Control 
City , State
In my position as Chief of the Reports Branch in Accounts Maintenance & Control (AM&C) I was responsible for ensuring the
development and standardization of various managerial and system reports.
I was responsible for the completeness and accuracy of weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports.
My branch monitored errors in the General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS/BQ) and ensured corrective actions were
accomplished.
I also ensured fund balances were reconciled and reports were verified prior to release to base activities and higher headquarters.
Limestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a
Directorate which previously did not exist.
My challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial
reporting was maintained.
As we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network.
I participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C.
Worked with management in determining FTEs needed for the branch.
I was responsible for developing meaningful performance standards for my employees since this branch and its functions did not previously
exist.
Limestone POC for an initiative to eliminate suspense accounts throughout the agency.
Identified suspense accounts not initially targeted, formulated strategies to eliminate accounts or requested waivers, and participated in plans
to modify processes using suspense accounts, such as the interfund suspense account.
These actions provided initial progress towards meeting the Department of Treasury's mandate to discontinue suspense accounts by
February 2009.
Worked with staff to reduce reconciliations from $6.9 million in February 2007 to $1.1 million in August, accomplished this despite loss in
experienced personnel and realigning resources to support critical initiatives in Accounts Payable.
I orchestrated the transition of reporting requirements for the Transportation Financial Management System (TFMS) workload from DFAS
Omaha to Limestone.
After transition to Limestone encouraged staff responsible for these reports to streamline the processes.
Staff automated a completely manual, time consuming process, thus eliminating potential key stroke errors and manually validating numerous
spreadsheets and listings.
Contributor to Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) Compliance Review and establishment of assessable units.
 Identified inconsistencies in information provided by staff on foreign currency fluctuation adjustments.
Persisted in getting higher level review of regulatory and policy guidance.

As Chief Of Accounts Payable I was responsible for the overall management of a branch consisting of over 120 employees.
My four first line supervisors were responsible for establishing priorities, schedules, and work assignments ensuring changes in workload are
accounted for to minimize the impact on normal office operations.
We consistently reviewed these areas and made necessary personnel moves based on shifting priorities.
This was extremely important during the DFAS Denver directed database consolidations and with the assumption of the Air National Guard
workload.
Workload increased rapidly while staffing increased gradually, which dictated frequent priority changes and personnel moves.
I also worked closely with the Major Commands supported by DFAS Limestone strengthening our partnership when workload spikes
negatively impacted our customers.
In December 2004, our overaged invoice percentage was nearing 25% and we had a backlog of vendor pay documents exceeding 30,000.
By working with the DFAS Command Client Executives and the Major Command Comptrollers, I was instrumental in forming a strategy
that included soliciting Air Force personnel assistance in document processing, identification of ""must pay now"" bills, and the formation of
special action response teams dedicated to responding to our customer's most urgent requirements.
As a result of these efforts, in a three month period, we were able to reduce our overaged invoice percentage by 19% and our backlog of
documents to no documents over 20 days old thereby minimizing the adverse impact on customer funds.
I was responsible for providing personnel feedback sessions quarterly and prepared supervisory appraisals of employees' performance and
potential for advancement.

performance to established DFAS Strategies and Balance Scorecard goals.

data produced to resolve these issues.

Force personnel.

Experience
January 2011
to
Current
Company Name City , State Purchaser / Production Coordinator
My journey at Flightstar began with production coordinating, where I was responsible for interfacing with leads, project managers, and
customer representatives regarding aircraft documentation, parts status, and any problems that may affect the delivery schedule.
In this position I was responsible for aircraft paperwork and work cards during the maintenance visits.
I worked one on one with purchasing to ensure the proper communication of parts that could affect aircraft delivery and help expedite these
parts as necessary.
When services were required either in house or items being sent out for any kind of testing or repair, I would provide complete and accurate
paperwork to purchasing.
Daily reporting of parts statuses, man hours, and aircraft schedule was a daily task.
Being a coordinator first and already having experience in purchasing made my transition to a buyer smooth since I could now work more
closely with the coordinators with each of us able to support one another better with part status updates and any paperwork issues.
Like coordinators I have to interface with leads, project managers, and customer representatives.
In addition I have to communicate between various departments at FAS such accounting to make sure that material is paid and billed
accurately as well as quality to make sure that the parts purchase are up to standard and come from an approved source.
Being on both sides of the fence I know see that coordinators spend more time corresponding between the different areas of the job where
buyers spend more time on parts themselves.
Purchasers are responsible for every part purchased or requested and Have the sole responsibility of resolving any materials needed.
I have to not only purchase the parts but also validate the paperwork or trace is acceptable and legal.
If it isn't, resolve any rejected parts by means of returns and credits.
Buyers are responsible for expediting all orders and making sure that they are received as needed.
We then report this information to the coordinators and project managers as necessary.
Outside vendor interaction is a big part of purchasing and we have to form business relationships to effectively perform or duties.
In addition I am responsible for meeting standards and performance metrics within the company to make that we are functioning at an
industry standard to rise above the competition.
Purchasing is also responsible for cost savings such engaging in supplier contracts and rebate programs.
These savings of course benefits everyone on the company.
Purchasers are a point of contact between FAS, suppliers, and customers regarding materials so effective communication and reporting is
key in this position.
February 2009

December 2010
Company Name City , State Purchasing Clerk / Material Specialist
Working with Vision Airlines included a lot of different responsibilities.
Not only was I responsible for quoting and purchasing materials for both Aircraft and Stock, but also included Stores / Warehouse,
Shipping, and Receiving responsibilities.
Being a smaller Airline I work closely with the Executive staff as well as the owners of the company themselves.
After receiving a Material Order Request, I would acquire the necessary quotes to find the best price and lead time available.
If needed, get approval to proceed with the order.
Coordinate and expedite the shipping and payment process to get the material where it needs to be in a timely manner.
I would match invoice with purchase orders and track shipments to assure their arrival.
Upon receipt of material, I then would verify proper certification of the material, receive into the system, and label as required.
Once material is ready to be used, issue from the system to assure all records was correct.
All of this required constant tracking using Excel, Word, and Adobe.
I kept records of all transactions whether it was materials needing to be ordered, Purchase Orders themselves, Invoices needing to be paid,
or items that that have already been received.
As well as certifications and any other information requested from maintenance.
 If an item needed to be shipped I was responsible for the proper packaging, handling, and traceability to be done in a professional manner.
As part of the AOG team I would be called on at any time to locate and facilitate the material where the urgent requirement may be.
This involved having key information to acquire the material and coordinate with the proper logistics necessary.
Also as a valued member of the material group I have represented the Airline at maintenance facilities to properly manage the material being
ordered and used for an Aircraft.
February 2005
to
January 2009
Company Name City , State Purchasing Agent / Material Expeditor
I started working as a Material Expeditor which required me to work closely with Purchasing, Maintenance, and the Airline.
Being an Expeditor had responsibilities that could change day by day depending on what was required of me.
I provided daily reports and expedited any material needed to keep the production process flowing efficiently.
This meant coordinating the order and shipment process, as well as the actual delivery of the material.
My responsibility as a Purchasing Agent is to find price and availability on material needed and then order and track for prompt shipment.
This requires me to deal directly with the vendors and develop relationships for future business.
I also retrieve any and all paperwork required, retrieving certification, submit any and all signatures necessary, and expedite the material in a
timely fashion.
Once I have received the material I then facilitate and expedite the flow of materials to and from various departments.
I have worked with many different Airline companies as well as Military, which all have high and demanding standards to meet.
With this job no two days are the same, it is a constant change with challenging obstacles.
In addition to being a Buyer and Expeditor, I was responsible for doing spare Sales to sister and contract companies.
This required the technique of verifying stock, quoting material, ensuring proper certification, and shipping.
Between the three job functions I was constantly providing and coordinating AOG orders support.
